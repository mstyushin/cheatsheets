Cheatsheets
===========

A list of some terminal (and probably other) operations that I did more than once and sick of googling them every time.

#### cheat

There is an [awesome tool](https://github.com/cheat/cheat/) for interacting with any cheatsheet you may have created (or may want to). Compatible cheatsheets will be stored at `./personal` directory within this repo. If you want to use them be sure to add this path to your `.config/cheat/conf.yaml`.
I'm going to duplicate my `.md` cheatsheets for a while, not sure however if it worth the effort.
